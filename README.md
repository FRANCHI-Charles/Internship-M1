# Code of "A first step in the direction to learn Saturated SRN"

In this repository, you can find all the code created during the project.

The dataset needed to train the Networks are avaible at: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.dncjsxm4h \
Paste it with the folder name `data` in the `RNN_automata` folder to make the code work.

The important files are:
- `RNN_automata/mlregtestplots.ipynb`, which contains the mains experiments
- `RNN_automata/automata.py`, which contains the mains object class and function made
- `RNN_automata/utils.py`, which contains other usefull functions
